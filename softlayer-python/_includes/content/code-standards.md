## Code Standards

All submissions should follow the <a href="http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008" target="_blank">PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code</a>. Also, as a suggestion, you can configure these settings in your editor to follow our coding style.

<pre>
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
end_of_line: lf
trim_trailing_whitespace = true
</pre>

> Names and formatting will vary across different editors.
