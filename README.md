# Pluck

A gang of JS plugins that've caused hairlines to recede. In other words, it's a storage repo for JS plugins used often to develop boilerplate or frameworks.

Its name originates not only from wanting to pluck our hair out while developing them, but also from the best [System Of A Down song](www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXwLxcSniGw) off their first album.
