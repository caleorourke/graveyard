# Elos

**Engineering. Labs. Open Source.**

Elos introduces a new **SoftLayer Engineering** page based on cursory [mock-up designs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molotovf/elos/gh-pages/mockup.pdf). The intent is to advertise what we do, how cool we are, and publicly showcase our teams (Labs, Engineering & Operations, and Open Source) to job candidates and visitors of [www.softlayer.com](www.softlayer.com).

## Local Preview

The following is a quick "how to" for cloning, installing, and running Elos locally.
