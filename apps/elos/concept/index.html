              <p>We’re pragmatic. Agile. Adaptive. Forward-thinkers in cutting-edge IaaS technology, and always looking for innovative ways to improve the cloud. Our ideas have a way of becoming great products and services. This is due in no small part to our adaptive, feature-driven philosophy for delivering valuable and innovative products.</p>

              <p>Our mission is simple: (1) Make the cloud extremely reliable, transparent, and ubiquitous. (2) Invest in technology that speaks to a broader audience. (3) Be the de facto platform on the Internet for cloud-based services. To achieve this, we employ a number of best practices, such as dogfooding our own work, forecasting where advances in technology will make the biggest crater, and eliciting user feedback to continuously improve our cloud offerings.</p>

          <h1>Labs</h1>

            <p>We start by taking fuzzy ideas that require heavy scoping or synthesis and constructing living proof-of-concepts. From there, we articulate the alignment of business, technology, and strategies with external conditions that help enable key decision-making for our CxOs.</p>

          <h3>Our Platform</h3>

            <p>We built our platform as a blend of converged solutions. Its design includes a collection of compute, network, storage, and software for mixing-and-matching services. Whether its Virtual Servers, Bare Metal, Block Storage, Private Clouds, or Load Balancing, our platform delivers unmatched scalability and control.</p>

          <h3>Projects From Labs</h3>

            <p>Ideas generally come from needing to scratch an itch. Having a strategy takes it beyond that itch. This is why every project is defined with high-level initiatives, business cases, and potential avenues for growth that frame our overarching strategy.</p>

            <p>Further downstream, we rope in other cross-functional teams, commit to significant milestones, and groom the project for productization as we ramp-up our effort toward a full-blown launch.</p>

          <h3>IBM Research</h3>

            <p>This is where swarms of talented researchers experiment with new ideas, validate results, steer our strategy accordingly, and ultimately decide how deep we go into the rabbit hole. Forecasting where technological advances might leave the biggest crater is critical for a cutting-edge business. That's why research is instrumental to our success. Here, we can validate long-term conditions, identify new opportunities, and make course-corrections early on.</p>

          <h1>Engineering & Operations</h1>

            <p>Engineering puts the emphasis in “making" while Operations puts the emphasis in “solving”. Our engineers are the connoisseurs behind our cutting-edge technology, including Private Cloud, Message Queue, and Object Storage.</p>

            <p>Always on the front-line of SoftLayer’s charge toward innovation, our team is not only talented engineers and specialists, we're also users, critics, and we understand why the product experience is so important to our customers.</p>

          <h3>Globally Distributed Systems</h3>

            <p>SoftLayer's approach to offering a global infrastructure inspired us to come up with a more efficient design: a low-latency, high-bandwidth network for running cloud services on a globally distributed system. Our engineers pushed the boundaries of what's possible by utilizing the global high-performance network, and what we ended up with is a harness for building highly available systems with more predictability and significantly higher performance when compared to alternative systems.</p>

          <h3>Core Infrastructure</h3>

            <p>From beginning to end, a number of deliverables must be gathered, vetted, and created for products and projects alike. We capture and sashimi them into workable chunks with a byproduct of improved performance, scalability, and automation.</p>

            <p>Whether its product delivery, quality testing, feature development or any number of code pushes each week, we strive to flexibly manage and continuously deliver IaaS products and services using faster development methods and quicker release cycles.</p>

          <h3>Emerging Technology</h3>

            <p>Working at the intersection where technology and business meet means we hunt for new challenges day-in and day-out. Our Engineering & Operation team take this head on at unprecedented speed and agility.</p>

          <h1>Open Source</h1>

            <p>Our combustion began at the grassroots level with free, open source software. Not only do we use it, we’re also firm believers in using open development and collaboration to make viable and sustainable products. Contributing back to the open source community allows us to work with a number of creative individuals and keep up-to-date on what's new.</p>

            <p>To date, we have <span id="github-repos"><i class="fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i></span> active open source projects on <a href="http://github.com/softlayer" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

          <h3>SL OSS Projects</h3>

            <p>With open source being at the helm of our community development at SoftLayer, we've pumped out a lot of great projects with help from our contributors.</p>

            <p>For example, our go-between for proprietary cloud controllers and OpenStack, <a href="http://softlayer.github.io/jumpgate" target="_blank">Jumpgate</a>, interfaces with every endpoint for the OpenStack APIs and shuffles data between the two. Our <a href="http://softlayer.github.io/knife-softlayer" target="_blank">Knife-SoftLayer</a> plugin let's you launch, bootstrap, and manage compute instances in the cloud. And then there's <a href="http://softlayer.github.io/softlayer-python/cli" target="_blank">Python CLI</a>. This little beauty gives you the facilities to spin-up virtual servers and provides seamless access to SoftLayer environments without having to grapple with APIs.</p>

            <p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/softlayer" target="_blank">our projects on GitHub</a> and contribute wherever you can make an impact.</p>

          <h3>Contributing</h3>

            <p>Our workflow follows the  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_blank">fork-pull model</a> and we leverage issues and pull requests for source control, bug fixes, and new feature development. Anyone is welcome to submit a request. All we ask is that you follow the Contributing Guidelines posted under each of our GitHub repositories.</p>

            <p>We license our code and documentation under the terms of the MIT license. Contributing to any open source project means that you're agreeing to license your contribution under the terms of this license.</p>
