# Contributor Guidelines

Like many of our projects, the {{site.project.alias}}---with the {{site.project.name}} tucked inside---is open source. We host it, develop it, and maintain it on GitHub.

Our dev workflow follows the <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests" target="_blank">fork-pull model</a> and leverages <a href="{{site.github.issues_url}}" target="_blank">issues</a> and <a href="{{site.github.pulls}}" target="_blank">pull requests</a> for source control, bug fixes, and new feature development. Anyone is welcome to submit a request, but we ask that you follow a few simple guidelines in regards to:

* [Code Standards](#toc_1)
* [Pull Requests](#toc_2)
* [Feature Requests](#toc_3)
* [Issue Reporting](#toc_4)
