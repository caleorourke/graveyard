## Pull Requests

We accept all types of pull requests, just as long as they stay within our scope and don't break compatibility downstream. If you're unsure about what impact your request might have, send us a [New Feature request](#toc_3) first. This gives us a chance to vet it before you start working on something that we may decide not to merge.

On a different note, the best ways to get a pull request merged quickly include:

* Following the [coding standards](#toc_1)
* Submitting requirements or test cases
* Providing a detailed explanation of whatâ€™s changing
