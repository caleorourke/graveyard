## Issue Reporting

Got issues? Here are some suggestions to help guide you through escalating it to us.

### Screen Our Issues on GitHub

### Use Our Template to Write-up the Report

A good report should not require anyone to pine for more information. That's why we suggest using this template. It's sufficient for the majority of reports --- albeit some issues may require us to ask for more details.

2. This is the second step
