# Introduction to {{site.project.name}}

{{site.project.name}} is a command-line utility that bootstraps our API and provides access to your SoftLayer environment. It also lets you create virtual servers with *a la carte* features like: 

* Computing cores
* RAM
* Storage types
* Storage sizes, and more

Aside from its functionality, {{site.project.name}} is simply a reference implementation of our Python Client. And since it draws power from our client, you'll need to install the {{site.project.alias}} in order to get the CLI. 

To make this process easy, we bundled them together into one package---the <a href="{{site.github.repository_url}}" target="_blank">{{site.project.alias}}</a>. Once it's installed, you can access the CLI easily by running the `sl` command.
